<h1>The best movies according to Frankie</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Mary Poppins</h3>
<p>Not that new Poppins either. I'm talking about the OG, Mary P! 
The one who made the longest, most exciting word using all of the alphabet letters. 
And also had her mans dancing with penguins.</p>
<h3>Scarface</h3>
<p>Gangster drug dealer aside, Scareface showed real life issues.
He showed the struggles of a Cuban immigrant, how to steal your girl, and how to 
NOT f over your bestie by dating their siblings.</p>
<h3>Encanto</h3>
<p>Do I NEED a reason? Its ENCANTO. The whole movie is my JAM.</p>
